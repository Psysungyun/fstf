                These days, I'm trying street performance in front of KLCC.<br>
                But I couldn't even make people to come to me and watch me.<br>
                So I bought Contact ball which is used for juggling. But still I couldn't do it<br>
                Probably next time I'm going try with playing musics to attract people.<br>

                <p class="event-exp">29 OCTOBER 2022, Kota Kinabalu<br>
                this performance is my favorite performance I've ever done.<br>
                Me and my dad went to Kota Kinabalu for trip and we hiked the highest mountain in South East Asia.<br>
                My leg was really hurt and we was taking rest on the beach a few hours before our flight. I wanted to perform so we put my table on the beach and<br>
                my dad was taking video of me. Few minutes later, one person came and he asked me to show
                him one trick. I showed him with differnt kind of force techniques and he started to call his
                group members. I performed with ring, sponge ball, card and it was such a amazing time.<br><br>
                They really enjoyed my performance and I also really enjoyed that moment<br>
                After this performance, I'm willing to do successful street performance again.<br>

                <p class="event-exp">1 OCTOBER 2022, kinghenryviii cyberjaya<br>
                this performance was my second performance in front of a large audience<br>
                I was staying in boarding for about 1month. because My dad went on a business trip.<br>
                and there was one event, "Boarder's God Talent" and I obviously performed<br>
                I only did card magic and it was disappointing. I combined 2 acts together<br>
                But because of less practicing time, I couldn't do it perfectly and it was a bit boring.<br>
                However, I also did some single tricks and it worked really well.<br><br>
                I started to learn magic tricks on 2022 march in this performance,<br>
                my magic techniques were not perfect enough. This made me to practice more,<br>
                and It improved my magic skills better.

                <p class="event-exp">1 JULY 2022, kinghenryviii cyberjaya<br>
                this performance was my first performance in front of a large audience<br>
                before this performance, I only showed my tricks to my friends, family or teachers<br>
                But that time I went up to the stage and showed my tricks to whole school<br>
                I got the chance to performe on the stage from one of my teacher. he asked me to go up and
                for only that 7 minuates, I practiced more than 20hours.<br><br>
                Honestly, I don't really like my self in that performance. because even I used too many magic props<br>
                like svengali deck, torch to flower, fire wallet that performance was disappointing for current me.
                <br>but still it holds many meanings for me because it was my FIRST PERFORMANCE</p>
